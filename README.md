I am a full stack senior software engineer working on websites, backend and mobile. My main passion is learning new things, and if i build something cool or usefull i try to turn it into a OSS project. Some technologies I enjoy working with include .NET Core, razor pages, web API's (REST) and Xamarin.Forms.
